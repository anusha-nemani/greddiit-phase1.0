## Instructions to run the frontend

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

NOTE :

1. node_modules and build folder are not included. To run the react app, all the required packages are to be installed. To do this, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

2. Make sure that the browser's dark mode is disabled, as the code does not provide that functionality.

3. Enter the below credentials to login:

```
username: admin
password: admin
```

4. URLs accessible currently:

```
/ - home page (i.e., login and register page)
/dashboard/profile - My profile page (appears as soon as the user logins)
```
